# removeYoutubeShorts
I hate youtube shorts.... get rid of them

'ytd-rich-section-renderer' is the element that is used to display shorts and those promo bars that try to sell you movies
'ytd-reel-shelf-renderer' is the custom element that is used to display shorts under a video
All this extension does is remove these elements any time they are added to the document
